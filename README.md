## Company Beginnings
In 2000, Sea Monster Crowdfunding (SMC under the Atlantian Inc. umbrella), was founded by heiresses Thalassia Tideborne and Nerissa Wavecaster in downtown Poseidonis, Atlantis. 

Fueled by their lifelong gaming obsession, the sisters embraced the motto *"Where Big Dreams Meet Big Waves"* and set out to reshape the indie gaming world. 

SMC specializes in funding and championing the most bizarre, bold, and boundary-pushing indie gamesâ€”projects so unique, even the surface world did not know that it needed.
